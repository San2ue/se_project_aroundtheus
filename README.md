project 3 is about using Figma to create a web page in the format most likely used in the work place.
And to make that web page responsive for multiple screen types.

# project 4: Around the U.S.

Project 4 is about setting up javascript for future projects and showing that we understand the basics
of Arrays and object structure. As well as setting up a user function to be able to edit profile name and description. Also removing the hard coded cards(images and thier names) and setting them up for future use.
